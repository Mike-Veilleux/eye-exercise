This repo contains the eye exercise from my MIT Full Stack development course.

## Description
Eyes are following the mouse movement on screen. This exercise targets a few skills building
- “onmousemove” event subscription
- Reading mouse event properties
- Usage of “absolute” and “relative” in CSS
    
## Install
Clone this repo and launch the index.html file in your browser.
  
## Live Demo
Click **[here](https://mike-veilleux.github.io/exercises/eye-exercise/index.html)** to see these creepy eyes in action on my website. 
  
## Roadmap
There are many upgrades possible for this project. Here's a few on my mind:
-  Use a real picture instead of html shapes
- Update the eyes tracking system to account for when the mouse is between both eyes
  
## Licensing
This project is under MIT license. Use it as you wish!
